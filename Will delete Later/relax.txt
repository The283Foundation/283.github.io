***Clarification: Only to differentiate between Members, their name from the outside world is used. Their real names are of course all 283.
The [] refer to files, at means attachment. Not yet implemented, maybe someday I'll post the according files with it.***


0. THE BEGINNING:
In the beginning, there was no 283. Just vile hatred and wildness. But on the 8th of February, 2023 at 21:53, OliwierMix send an invite link in the counting thread of the capitalist server "Duck Simulator" which lead to the glorious server "283".
At 21:54, OliwierMix spoke out the first words into the void of 283. "283", he said, and 283 it became.
At that moment, Morpekorby joined the server, asking Oliwier if he seriously made a server for this, followed by a sobbing emoji. This truly displayed their emotions of doubt. But as Oliwier spoke again: "283", Morpekorby realized the beauty of 283 and prayed for 283.
At 22:12, Caeruleus posted the first message in #283-server-icon-contest. It was "FIRST", accompanied by his server Icon, a duck with transparent Background and "283" written in Black in front of it [see at1]. It is  to be said that this was in the early days of 283, which is why the uniqueness and uncomparable spirit of 283 was not as widely accepted as nowadays.
Three minutes later, Oliwier announced the channel "#283-server-icon-contest", in which followers could propose an icon for the server. At 22:04, Caeruleus, the writer of this, joined the server, proclaiming to the world:"I LOVE 283!". The joining was followed by a series of 4 messages, showing the early feelings of questioning in the 3.
26 minutes later, Morpekorby posted a screenshot of paint, showing 283 written in black [see at2]. Below they sent "283". The exact thought process behind this is unbeknownst to this day. This activity following the creation was quickly stopped, and a draught lasting nearly 5 days set in.
On the 13th February at 18:57, Caeruleus said "this server is still epic, long live 283".
A minute later, Oliwier send "#283-chat", but what this message originally was is unknown, since this message was edited. The same minute, Oliwier sent the message "303:283" in the Duck Simulator server.
A day later at 6:40 Morpekorby posted, "#283-server-icon-contest", the purpose of this is unknown too. At 14:29, Oliwier pinged himself. Why is not fully clear. One minute before that, Caeruleus sent the message "rule 305: join 283" to the counting thread of the DS server. This was an attempt to show more people the truth of 283. Oliwier replied the same minute with "306:283", to which Caeruleus replied with "307:283" 2 minutes later.
On the 15th and 16th, both Morpekorby and Caeruleus sent 283, each one time both days.
On the 16th, at 15:11, AstroYTXD joined the server. At 16:34, Oliwier greeted him with Discord sticker greeting, and at 17:10 Caeruleus sent "283!", to which Astro replied with "283!", showing Unity even amongst the new.
On the 16th at 16:26, Caeruleus tried to persuade Orius, the cruel capitalist dictator of the DS server, to add 283 to the official server list. Orius of course ignored this request of a minority, showing his true ignorance and hatred against minorities.
EliTheGingercat opened a thread on this suggestion, asking about the server. Morpekorby sent an invite, and later on the 20th told Eli to join it. Eli replied with "no" and "sus", showing once again the capitalist ignorance of the DS server people.
On the 17th at 9:32, Le Fishe joined the server, saying "this is a 283 moment", Caeruleus replied to that with "fr fr 283", Le Fishe to that with "literally 283", quite possibly a reference to the novel 1984 by George Orwell, quite possibly comparing 283 to the bad goverment in the novel. We hope he didn't mean that, or else...
Oliwier told him to change his name to 283 at 15:12. He complied, and Oliwier said "good :)". At that point, Le Fishe sent his proposition for the server icon, showing the number 283 made of duck pngs behind a black background.[See at3] This, once again, still had not enough 283 in focus.
At 15:43, Caeruleus said "this is starting to feel like some communist dictatorship. Anyway, hail 283", which is obviously not true, and he regrets ever saying that.
At 20:17, Morpekorby posted an image in #283-server-icon-contest. the image was simple, yet ingenious. It showed a red background with a small yellow duck in the upper left corner. In the middle was a tilted sickle, which looked like a 2, and the numbers 8 and 3, creating the number 283 [See at4-1]. The same image was posted again, this time as a square [See at4-2].
Silence followed, but on the 25th Oliwier said "anyone who changes their nickname to 284 will be permanently banned. ip banned in the future too". Le Fishe asked "what about 285", with Oliwier replying: "yeah i don't care about that". 283 showed concerns that this might be a trap, and Caeruleus saying the same, since 283 is the only good number. Le Fishe then informed all that 283 is a prime number.
Caeruleus replied with "Great", Le Fishe with "grate" and Caeruleus with "crate".
On the 26th, at 00:36, Caeruleus sent the message "Treachery", attached was an image of two messages [See at5]. The first showed Caeruleus saying "348: 283 my beloved", and the second Oliwier saying "349 boyboy better", with a gif link attached, showing a heart locket opening, showing boyboy.
Oliwier replied at 12:04 with "283 is good, but boyboy is better". Caeruleus replied with a gif of a duck shaking its head. Morpekorby also voiced their concerns regarding this act of treacherous behavior. Later at 21:37, Oliwier threatened to ship boyboy and 283, with Caeruleus saying "don't you dare...283", following the trend of attaching 283 at the end of every message at the time.



1. Little in March/April:
March was dry, with nothing during the entire first half of the month.
On the 15th of March though, at 8:02, Le Fishe wrote "dead chat 283", followed by them pinging himself a lot of times. Morpekorby replied with "revive chat" at 10:12, pinging themselves once. Caeruleus then pinged everyone with the role 283, which was everyone, by accident, with Oliwier telling him not to and Caeruleus apologizing.
On the 17th, during an multilingual argument, Oliwier send the message "gadajcie po polsku albo zbanujÄ™ was z 283!!1!1!!1!1!", which roughly translates to "talk in Polish or I will ban you from 283!!1!1!!1!1!". This was the first time such a threat was spoken, but the frevelous capitalists of the DS server didn't take this threat seriously.
10 days later, Le Fishe send the message "dead chat 283.0000000000000000000000000000000001", Caeruleus replied to that with "bad number". The next day, Morpekorby said "283", followed by a heavily sweating, quite possibly aroused emoji. On the 1st of April, Le Fishe send the link to the wikipedia article of the year 283. They got no response, which made it the only message in April, ending the second active phase, marking the beginning of a month-long draught.



2. Glorious March
On the 1st of March 2023, Le Fishe send a message, only a sticker showing 283 in white on a black background. The sticker was from a private server[See at6].
On the 2nd, Morpekorby asked if they couldn't just agree on their proposed server icon. Caeruleus replied asking since when 283 is communist, which it of course is not. Morpekorby replied with the message of Caeruleus, which stated that it started to feel like a communist regime. Caeruleus then agreed that this should be the server icon.
On the 10th of March, it was made the official server icon of 283. Later Le Fishe exclaimed "TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THRE", with Morpekorby replying with "283", followed by a thinking emoji. Le Fishe then posted the sticker repeatedly, and Morpekorby said "that needs to be an official emoji". On the DS server counting thread, multiple individuals posted summations containing the number 283 instead of the actual full numbers. This was started when Morpekorby sent the invite for the 283 server, with Eliza asking who joined that server, but she didn't join the server herself sadly.
At 16:09, Panguan joined the server, gladly saying "283".
On the 11th, Morpekorby for some reason posted the parachute emoji, and Caeruleus responded with the number 283 as number emojis. Le Fishe then wrote 283 in form of three gifs [See At7-1/2/3] and send 4 identical gifs of a heart locket opening, showing the text "283 my beloved" on one side and the 283 sticker on the other side[See at8]. Caeruleus reposted the gif then for some reason.
Starting at 20:00 of the 11th March, people started posting 283 with various emojis, showing their love and devotion to 283. This lasted until 16:00 of the 12th. At 16:01, Oliwier send an Omori gif saying "i do not respect you", combined with the message "me when someone say they don't like 283" [See at9].
On the 12th at 16:14-16:53, Panguan, Le Fishe, AstroYTXD and Caeruleus posted 283 spelled out in English, Chinese, Polish and German. This activity was followed by a time of silence until March 23rd.
On March 23rd, Morpekorby and then Caeruleus posted 283, Caeruleus with a smiley [:)].
At 9:28, Le Fishe posted a gif of a man angrily slapping his hand on his desk, with the number 283 in the top left corner. Three minutes later, Caeruleus posted a gif of a heart locket opening, revealing the text 283 my beloved on one side and the server icon on the other [See at10-1]. 10 minutes later, Le Fishe send a gif of a laptop opening [See at10-2]. Caeruleus followed with a quote of "your mom" saying "I love 283" [See at10-3] 4 minutes later. 7 minutes later, Le Fishe send a quote of him in 2023 saying "283" [See at10-4]. They then continued posting some "memes" about 283, expressing their love for 283.



3. March 24th:
The day started off with Morpekorby posting the wikipedia link to the year 283 and creating a thread in which they would say a word of the article every day.
At 12:42, Oliwier created and gave himself the 80089 role. He then went on to create the channel #283-announcements and move the #283-server-icon-contest to the new category "283 archives".
At 12:56, he made the first glorious official announcement of 283, announcing the addition of the @80089 role, the addition of #283-announcements and archiving of #283-server-icon-contest, and the plan of reaction roles. The announcement also had a poll about whether or not to post the 283 invite in the Iceberg server. The vote went 4:0 for opening it, so Oliwier did so at 17:34.
At 17:34, GoldZook joined the server, immediately proclaming his name always was 283, showing his loyalty to 283.
Oliwier then told GoldZook "welcome to the 283 cultists", to which Panguan immediately replied with "Wait this isn't a cult. It's a community. With a strict set of rules. With a singular concept we worship" and Caeruleus 2 minutes later: "We're just a passionate group of Individuals who really like the number 283. We do not conduct any communism/cultism around here. (kind of)".
Le Fishe then asked since when the server has been active, and Caeruleus replied with "since always, don't let capitalist 284 lies deceive you". Panguan also said "283 gang 4 lyfe".
OliwierMix then renamed himself to 80089, causing mixed reactions from members. In response to that, Le Fishe renamed himself to "22665187", which is 283 cubed, or 80089 times 283. Caeruleus then renamed himself to "1.8152322e+12", which is equal to 283^5, or 80089 times 22665187. This created a lot of tension and division in the server, but Oliwier calmed down everyone by suggesting to change everyones name to 283.
This momemtary moment of division was prompty blamed on Moses and 284, which of course was the true reason for all this.
At 18:00, Oliwier created the 80089 category and the #80089-chat. Panguan was shown this secret channel by 283, and Oliwier nearly used a swear word, which he promptly deleted. But Panguan could see that too.
Oliwier went on to rename #283 to #283-chat and create the channels #283-images and #283-memes. He then added the Reaction Roles bot, created the channel #283-roles and added the @283-announcements role.
At 18:03, Caeruleus posted an image of the German "BundestraÃŸe 283" sign and Le Fishe posted an image showing all multiplications of 283 with the numbers of 1 to 20.
At 18:11, Caeruleus posted all the bad memes from before in the #283-memes channel. Le Fishe "complained" about the stolen memes, but Caeruleus argued with communism. Panguan corrected him, because they weren't communists, so Caeruleus changed it to 283-ism.
Panguan proposed the tenets of 283 at 18:20, which Oliwier didn't want to make.
Le Fishe also posted a poem about 283 from ChatGPT, and Oliwier pinned that poem, making it the first pinned message. Caeruleus then volunteered to make the tenets of 283, which Oliwier allowed. Le Fishe then posted another poem from ChatGPT, which were highly offensive though, due to their commandments about uniqueness and other devious propaganda like that.
At 18:25, Oliwier split the server channels into two more categories besides archived:
"283-important" and "283". "283-important" contained #283-rules, #283-announcements, and #283-roles. "283" contained #283-chat, #283-images, and #283-memes.
At 18:31, Oliwier set up the rules. The Reaction Roles bot also got the new bot role   @100011011.
At 18:43, Oliwier made the third announcement, announcing that the server is no longer a mess, that theres 5 new channels and that there are new roles, @100011011 and @283 announcements.
At 20:27, Oliwier granted Caeruleus officially the permission to view the audit log for the creation of this text.
At 21:23 of March 24th, Caeruleus posted the first version of "History of 283"
